# 🧾 Customer Support Ticket Classifier & Entity Extractor

An end-to-end ML and NLP pipeline that classifies customer support tickets by **issue type** and **urgency level**, and also extracts entities such as **product names**, **dates**, and **complaint keywords**.  

Built using traditional NLP techniques, scikit learn models, and rule based entity extraction ~ which are all connected through a gradio app.

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project processes raw customer support tickets and provides:  

- **Issue type classification** (e.g., hardware issue, software bug)  
- **Urgency level prediction** (e.g., low, medium, high)  
- **Entity extraction** of product names, dates, and complaint-related keywords  
- Interactive user input and output through a **Gradio web interface**

The pipeline uses a combination of **traditional NLP preprocessing**, **ML classifiers**, and **custom rule-based entity extraction**.
